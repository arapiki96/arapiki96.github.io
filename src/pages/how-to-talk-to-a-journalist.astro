  <h1>How to talk to a journalist</h1>

  <h2>Start with the essentials</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>What happened (in one sentence).</li>
    <li>Who is involved (names, roles, organisations).</li>
    <li>When it happened (dates, timeframes).</li>
    <li>What evidence exists (documents, emails, messages, photos).</li>
    <li>What you want to happen (tip, correction, context, investigation).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Ground rules: on the record, background, off the record</h2>
  <p><strong>On the record</strong>: I can quote you by name.</p>
  <p><strong>On background</strong>: I can use the information but not name you (terms must be agreed).</p>
  <p><strong>Off the record</strong>: I can’t publish or use it directly. (Best discussed before you share.)</p>

  <h2>Documents and links</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Share original documents where possible.</li>
    <li>Tell me what the document is, who wrote it, and when.</li>
    <li>Highlight the exact paragraph/page that matters.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What makes a tip actionable</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Specific allegations or questions that can be checked.</li>
    <li>Named sources or records that exist.</li>
    <li>A clear public-interest angle.</li>
  </ul>
</BaseLayout>
